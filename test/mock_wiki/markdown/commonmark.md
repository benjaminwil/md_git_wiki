# CommonMark

From 2012, a group of people including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane launched
what Atwood characterized as a standardization effort. A community website now
aims to "document various tools and resources available to document authors and
developers, as well as implementors of the various markdown implementations". In
September 2014, Gruber objected to the usage of "Markdown" in the name of this
effort and it was rebranded as a new dialect named CommonMark. CommonMark.org
published several versions of a specification, reference implementation, and
test suite, and "[plans] to announce a finalized 1.0 spec and test suite in
2018."
