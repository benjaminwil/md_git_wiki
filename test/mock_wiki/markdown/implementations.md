# Implementations

Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming
languages; in addition, many platforms and frameworks support Markdown. For
example, Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.

While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is read and edited with a normal
text editor, there are specially designed editors that preview the files with
styles, which are available for all major platforms. Many general purpose text
and code editors have syntax highlighting plugins for Markdown built into them
or available as optional download. Editors may feature a side-by-side preview
window or render the code directly in a WYSIWYG fashion.

- The source code documentation generator Doxygen supports Markdown with extra
  features.
- RStudio, an IDE for R, provides a C++ wrapper function for a markdown variant
  called sundown.
- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) ignores underscores in words, and adds syntax
  highlighting, task lists, and tables.
- Discount – a C implementation.
- MarkAPL is a converter written in Dyalog APL. It supports fenced blocks, smart
  typography, link references, and special attributes, and can generate a table
of contents.
- PHP Markdown - a library package that includes the PHP Markdown parser and its
  sibling PHP Markdown Extra with additional features.
- Markdig – A .NET library that follows the CommonMark specifications, and
  includes a collection of extensions and the ability for the user to create
  their own.
